When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Well, when it is no secret, or when I want somebody to help me, or even when I want a easy way to make backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because some commits does nt represent the job done completely, this way they should not go to the repository yes, in the same way, while We are working someone could send some changes to the repository and things could be messy if the sync could occur automatically.
