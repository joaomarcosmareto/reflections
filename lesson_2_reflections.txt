What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

we have to do this so git can track the files and the changes that occurs on thos files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area differs in the nature, its existence is temporary, only exists in the time between the git add and git commit. Its value resides in the fact that you can choose which files goes to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

if you modify many files you can separate what will be comitted. Making this many times you can separate your work in many different commits.
